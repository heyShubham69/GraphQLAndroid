**Hilt Android App Setup**

This project demonstrates a clean architecture implementation using **Hilt for Dependency Injection, Jetpack Compose for UI, and MVVM for state management.**

> Project Structure

- [x] Domain Layer: Contains the business logic and repository interfaces.

- [x] Data Layer: Implements repositories and handles data sources.

- [x] Presentation Layer: Manages UI components using Jetpack Compose and ViewModel.

> Key Technologies Used

- [x] Hilt: For Dependency Injection

- [x] Jetpack Compose: For modern UI development

- [x] MVVM: To separate concerns and manage UI state

- [x] Retrofit: For network calls

- [x] Coroutines & Flow: For asynchronous programming

> Features Implemented

- [x] Hilt Integration: Enables efficient dependency injection across the app.

- [x] Use Cases Implementation: Organizes business logic effectively.

- [x] LazyColumn UI: Displays a list of countries using Jetpack Compose.

- [x] Application Class Setup: Initializes Hilt in the app.

- [x] **Manifest Configuration:** Includes Internet permission for network access.

> Achievement

- Modular and scalable architecture following clean architecture principles.
- Decoupled code with better maintainability.
- Smooth UI interactions with Jetpack Compose.
- Efficient dependency management with Hilt.
